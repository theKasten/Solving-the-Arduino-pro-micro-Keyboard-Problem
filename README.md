# Solving-the-Arduino-pro-micro-Keyboard-Problem
With this code you can use a Arduino pro micro for keyboard injection, with any special carakters. This is maybe not the best and most preatty solution, but it works perfectly and leaves you with 90% of the memmory to upload your own code.

Have fun folks!
